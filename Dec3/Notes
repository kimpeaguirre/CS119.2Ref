It would be costly for a company to implement an enterprise database. But in Enterprise programming, what we're concerned with is not a specific technology, but to apply the concepts of the database and display that information to our client. 

Relational database- tables with corresponding fields

Application- driver, to access a specific technology
	-need to have credentials to be secure
	-logic, to perforn necessary programs

Query- Extract info from database and display it 
	select * from persons;


Abstraction layer- will apply a logic that will make it easier so that it won't be too expensive. An abstracted logic that maps the functionality into your underlying technology.
-often implemented in the MBC paradigm by the models
