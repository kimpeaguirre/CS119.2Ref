MVC Paradigm

Model- Data, business rules
View- Applicaions interface
Controller- controls flow of data or information throughout your system; or dictates where to go.

User sends a request to one of the controllers. Controller will process what the user sends.
Request- comprises of many things. Often contains a URL or a path to our system and the data.
		
		What controller does:

		1) Process the URL
			-will check routes. Which part of the system is the URL
		2) Call the necessary models and will build a response
		3) Return a response back to the user
			-wil contain a combination of view and model. View will paint a picture (in terms of an interface) of what the model wants to show.


STARTING WITH RAILS 

rails new petstore

	controller folder  
		petstore > app > controllers > concerns > application_controller
			create a new file in the controller folder --> pages_controller.rb (The name of your controller is pages and not pages controller)
	go to routes.rb
		config > routes.rb

To run it, go to where you created the rails, and then rails s on terminal
uncomment therubyracer, and then bundle install again
	you can get them from rubygems.org
